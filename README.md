# house-party
**This application is designed to allow multiple people to control the current song playing on any device using spotify. It was created using React.js and Django.**

<br>
It works by one person being the host of the music room (this person must have spotify premium). The host can customize the room's settings, such as granting permission for guests to play/pause the music and by choosing the minimum number of votes to have in order to skip this song.

<br>
<br>
Before the room is actually created, the host will be asked to sign into their spotify account. This allows the house party application have to the user's Spotify account, song/artist information, and actual controls to play/pause the music on spotify, and to skip the song.

<br>
<br>
Once the user has signed into their account, they enter the music room. The host's view of the room will display the room code for guests to join, display the song information, the skip and play/pause buttons, song duration, and a feature to change the room's settings. If the host closes the room and decides later to create a new, different room, the host will not be asked to sign into their Spotify account again because the application will remember their session key.

For guests, the will enter the room by entering the right room code.

<br>
Once guests join the room, their view of the room is almost identical to the host's, but they don't have a settings button at the bottom.

And that's it! Now everyone has control of the music :)
